# Portfolio
Hello. My name is Jeff and this repo contains a portfolio of my work. Please see each folder for more specific instructions saving the following:

* Here is another example written in Elm which I wrote. The program used a backend that my friend @yurrriq (https://github.com/yurrriq/) wrote in haskell. He has since begun rewriting the project in Erlang, however that rewrite is no longer finished so the backend cannot be included. Still I wished to show the fact that I can write FRP in Elm and the code should be fairly straight forward to someone who has some familiarity with the language.
